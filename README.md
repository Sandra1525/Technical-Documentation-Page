# Technical-Documentation-Page
Every language, software, hardware, etc. has technical documentation for information and help. Here is how you can create a simple documentation page, with internal linking from the left navigation to the content on the right of the page. You can check out the documentation for Python, Java, Arduino, etc. for reference on how these pages look.
